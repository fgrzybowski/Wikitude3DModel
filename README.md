# Wikitude3DModel

Here is a model for Wikitude SDK on Android

Wikitude posess a sample app for all its features, but here is an implementation for the 3D Model only

What to do with the code ?

You have to request a license key on wikitude website and put it in the Constante class, without it the code won't work

To request a license key you need to register on Wikitude and follow this link : http://wikitude.com/developer/licenses

Now that you have put your key into the class Constante, you can run the project.

For the model to appear you have to scan this image : http://www.wikitude.com/external/doc/documentation/4.0/vuzix/images/carAd.jpg

I hope it'll helps you
